# Gaia-Wilson-Bappu
An elegant metric, for a more civilized age

## Background
Gaia DR3 contains many robust parallax measurments, AND spectra of the Ca II "infrared triplet" (IRT), which is a chromospheric activity indicator and subject to similar line broadening/damping effects as Ca II HK (and Mg II hk).  **This data opens up many new project ideas!** Some papers worth revewing...

[Ayres (1979)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979ApJ...228..509A/abstract): The classic paper discussing the Wilson-Bappu Effect

[George Wallerstein+1999](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999PASP..111..335W/abstract), calibrated it using HIPPARCOS parallaxes.

[Andretta+2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...430..669A/abstract): Ca II IRT as an activity diagnostic, defining $R_{IRT}$

[Bus√†+2007](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007A%26A...466.1089B/abstract): Ca II IRT as an activity diagnostic, tesing with high res spectra

[Cauzzi+2008](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...480..515C/abstract) The solar chromosphere at high resolution with IBIS. I. New insights from the Ca II 854.2 nm line

[Martin+2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...605A.113M/abstract): Empirical calibration of Ca II IRT to Ca II HK for activity

We expect Gaia DR3 team to release a study of Ca II IRT, according to the [planned papers](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr3-papers).

Lanzafame, et al.

## Ideas
- Can we reproduce the Wilson-Bappu Effect (WBE) with Gaia DR3 data alone? (i.e. spectra + parallaxes)?
- Calibrate the WBE from *other* Ca II HK data, using Gaia parallaxes (this obviously can be done)
- Look for distance outliers between the parallax & WBE-implied luminosity.
- Use the 7-year timespan of Gaia to look for Ca II IRT variations, indicating activity cycles
